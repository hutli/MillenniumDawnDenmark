Initially, their authoritarian style was greeted by the public - in the hope of peace - but their terror regime and the steps back for Afghanistan soon caused further resentment. The more worldly and socially liberal 'Islamic State of Afghanistan' was set up against the 'Islamic Emirate', and a rebel army in the north of Afghanistan, the 'Northern Alliance', rose to conquer all of Afghanistan from the Islamic Emirate.\n\nWhich of these forces is better for Afghanistan?"

By 2010, opinion polls routinely suggested that Labor would not be able to win the next election if it continued on this path. According to ABC's 7:30 Report', the seeds for Gillard to challenge candidate Rudd were sown by "Victorian Right factional heavyweights" Bill Shorten MP and Senator David Feeney, who had between them secured the support of "New South Wales power broker" Mark Arbib. Feeney and Arbib discussed the matter of a potential leadership challenge with Gillard on the morning of 23 June and began a numbers count to establish the feasibility of a leadership challenge. The pair found that there was more than enough support for Gillard for the challenge to proceed. The declining ratings for both the Labor Party and Rudd personally were attributed to many factors, including problems with the Home Insulation Program, a significant delay to a planned carbon emissions reduction scheme, a move to introduce mandatory internet filtering, the proposed introduction of the Resource Super Profits Tax, and the election of Tony Abbott as Leader of the Opposition. Senior Labor MPs conceded that the ALP's primary vote had dropped below 30% in some key marginal seats, a figure which if replicated at a federal election would have seen a Labor defeat."

Former state minister Alannah MacTiernan reported a consistent message from voters at doorstops that they would not vote for federal Labor later in the year, and called for Gillard to accept that she could not win an election and to stand down. Later in March, amid criticism of Gillard's handling of media law reform proposals—called "shambolic" by a key crossbencher—Chief Whip Joel Fitzgibbon confirmed that Labor Party members were "looking at the polls and expressing concerns". On 21 March at 1pm AEDST, former Labor leader Simon Crean called for a spill of all leadership positions and announced that he would support Kevin Rudd for leader and would himself stand for the deputy leadership. He was critical of Gillard and treasurer Wayne Swan for not communicating effectively with voters. In response, Gillard sacked Crean from Cabinet and called a leadership spill for 4.30pm AEDST that afternoon.

By 10 June 2013, the security of Gillard's position as leader was plunged into doubt following the loss of significant support in the Labor caucus, as well as persistently bad opinion polling that indicated Labor could be left with the low number of 40 seats in the House of Representatives. ABC News reported that "some former staunch supporters" now held the view that Gillard could not win the upcoming election, and ABC journalist Barrie Cassidy identified former Leader Kevin Rudd as the only feasible replacement. The political editor of The Australian newspaper, Dennis Shanahan, reported on 10 June that Rudd had been "mobbed" by members of the public in Geelong on 7 June 2013, and that he was "expected to be returned to the ALP leadership". On 26 June, rumours began to spread that supporters of Rudd were circulating a caucus petition calling for a vote to challenge Gillard for the leadership. In an interview with Sky News Australia that afternoon, Gillard told interviewer David Speers that she had not seen the rumoured petition, and jokingly called it the "political equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster". She also said that nobody had approached her to advise they intended to challenge her. Gillard then proceeded to call a leadership election for 7:00pm that evening in order to end the speculation, declaring that she would retire from politics if she lost, and called on any potential challenger to make the same commitment.Kevin Rudd announced in a press conference shortly afterwards that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost."

Earlier in the year the ALP caucus approved changes to the way the federal parliamentary leader is chosen. The new rules make it more difficult to change leaders and require a ballot of the party membership on contested leadership spills. The new rules encourage the parliamentary party to only nominate one candidate, to avoid a month-long ballot of the general party membership. The new rules are controversial, however, and have been publicly criticised by ALP Senator Stephen Conroy and former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Nominations opened at a parliamentary party meeting on Friday 13 September 2013, and remained open for a week. Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten formally nominated.

After the Liberal Party meeting concluded, Abbott made a televised statement in which he said that 'The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us'. Michelle Grattan, writing in The Conversation, argued that the 'narrow margin' of the vote left the party Leader 'deeply vulnerable to later destabilisation'.

On the other side of the country, Julie Bishop met with members of the West Australian Liberal Party to discuss her plan of action in the looming leadership spill.

France quickly showed itself to be a hot favorite for the title after eliminating Spain and then the reigning World Champion Brazil, followed by Portugal; making their way into the finals. France however met its superior in Italy (4th title), which had defeated Australia, Ukraine and the German hosts.\nThe most famous scene of the world cup was French legend Zinedine Zidane headbutting an Italian player during the final and getting sent off during the final, ending a great career on a very low note."

Spain came out ahead after extra time, beating the Oranje 1-0.

However, the Spanish title holder was eliminated in the group stage, together with England and Italy, two of the European great powers of football. Uruguay, France and Brazil were all eliminated before the finals, where Germany and Argentina met. Germany eventually took the match in extra time, winning 1-0.\nThe most remarkable moment of the contest was when five-times champion Brazil was eliminated in their home world cup with a devastating 7-1 against Germany in the semi-finals."

Bush received 50.4 million votes, Gore 50.99 million, but, thanks to an incredibly close race in Florida, which was decided by less than 600 votes, Bush won Florida and thus the presidency.

 election_USA.5.d1:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 might have been one of the most heated and ideologically charged political showdowns of the 21st Century. The Election was, in the best style of American democracy, not decided by committed supporters of either side, but by regular people who found the candidate they did not vote for unbearable as president. \n\nSucceeding a strong eight years under a democratic government, the Democratic Party quickly fell into a two-candidate battle between declared Democratic Socialist and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on one side, and former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on the other. Clinton, although accused of corruption and overly friendly stances towards international companies, managed to beat Sanders with a mix of party corruption and a strong support base in the more conservative states in the south and center of the country. \n\nThe Republicans meanwhile found themselves unable to quickly designate a front runner, with more than a dozen candidates initially running. After eliminating his competitors John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, reality show star and billionaire Donald Trump won with aggressive rhetoric and with a style of providing simple answers to complicated questions. \n\nThe disapproval ratings for both candidates pass 50% of the populous. Neither party finds anything appealing about the other candidate. Both rational and widely popular candidates have failed. It has come down to one final question - A woman deeply involved with big business and shady dealings or a man regularly publishing neo-fascist propaganda on social media?"
 election_USA.5.d2:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has become a battle of two wings of populism.\n\nAfter the Democratic Nomination had been a close race that once more ended up seeing Hillary Clinton as the loser, as before in 2008; the Republican race quickly had become dominated by a far-right rhetoric battle between Donald Trump and similar-minded contestants like Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.\n\nNow, both candidates promise to battle Wall Street influences and to give back America to the people. Who will it be? The independent senator, legend among left-wing progressives, from small Vermont, Bernie Sanders; or the successful and famous businessman from New York City, Donald Trump?"
 election_USA.5.d3:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been described as the 'battle of the sleeper agents' by a far-left online commentator. Both Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz, the two major candidates, are hugely unpopular and are booed by wings of their own party for their uncharismatic behavior. Both the \"Sanders Progressives\" and the \"Trump Nationalists\" hate their party's candidate and are looking into alternatives, like the Greens, the Libertarians and the Constitutionalists. Who will it be among the 'sleeper agents' then? Cruz or Clinton?"
 election_USA.5.d4:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been a lopsided affair, comparable to the Reagan, Nixon and Roosevelt landslides. Where the Democrats managed to bring a hugely popular progressive candidate, Bernie Sanders, into the mix; the Republicans failed to nominate a unifying candidate and went with Ted Cruz - a man that was described with flattering words like 'vindictive', 'straight-up evil' or 'the anti christ' even among fellow conservatives for his behavior of flip-flopping.\n\nThe polls are clear, Sanders is favored by a near 10% edge - but the electoral college is known to be a mischievous mistress. Can Cruz win?"
 election_USA.5.d5:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been titled 'battle of sociopaths' by left-wing TV host Bill Maher. Indeed it seems that both Republican candidate Marco Rubio and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton are unpopular, uncharismatic and pragmatic - but no one doubts that both of them have a certain talent as politicians.\n\nSo, which uninspiring, uncharismatic sociopath will it be? Marco Rubio from Florida or Hillary Clinton from New York?"
 election_USA.5.d6:0 "'I have never witnessed such a weak political performance, and that is saying something', neo-nazi leader Richard Spencer wrote about the first debate of the 2016 US Presidential Election.\n\nIndeed, there is not much to be had for far-right voters when looking at the battle of two moderates, comparable to the 1992 election between Clinton and Bush Sr.\n\nThis time, Democratic candidate for nomination Clinton - but the female one - failed to overcome a far-left challenger in the form of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nSanders and Rubio, apart from the far right criticism, have both been praised by the media for their respective campaigns that very much focussed on issues rather than mudslinging. 'If this holds up, we might actually restore a political discourse', Bill O'Reilly commented on the election race.\n\nSo, who will it be?"
 election_USA.5.d7:0 "'Kasich versus Clinton. If that sounds boring, wait until you see it.', TV show host Bill Maher snarked at the candidates the two major political parties chose.\n\nThe US Presidential Election of 2016 has been a shock to both far left and far right voters. Both campaigns have super moderate candidates, both campaigns have largely abstained from mudslinging moves, both campaigns have been described as being lead by 'corrupt kleptocrats' by an MSNBC commentator.\n\nThat sounds demotivating, but one these needs to be president. So let's go for it! Who will it be? Clinton or Kasich?"
 election_USA.5.d8:0 "'This had to have been the most left-wing campaigns I ever saw in my life, it's horrible', Ann Coulter complained on Fox News about the second Presidential Debate of the 2016 US Election.\n\nA far left Democrat, Bernie Sanders, meets a very moderate fiscal Republican, John Kasich, in the arena of the longest and most expensive election of not only American but also world history.\n\nSanders slashed Kasich, the governor of Ohio, for his stance on Planned Parenthood and his cowardly mannerisms when dealing with big business, while Kasich called Vermont senator Sanders out for the very extended gun rights in his home state, thus making Sanders' gun control platform one of hipocrisy.\n\n'This campaign has been highly productive and interesting', a British foreign policy observer commented on the BBC. The global and internal interest is now reaching its peak on election day. Who will win?"

 vatican.1.d:0 "The Lateran Treaties were signed by Italy and the Vatican during the fascist era in Italy. The Treaties recognized the Vatican City as an independent micro-state, completely surrounded by the city of Rome. Perhaps, since Italy is now a country ruled by a fascist regime, is it time to renew the treaties?"
