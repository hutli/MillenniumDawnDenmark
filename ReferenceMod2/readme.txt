CHANGELOG (up to date as of 2017.02.28)
v 3.2.0
	- This version is now compatible with the 1.3.3 patch of the base game (previous versions had issues with the focus tree, if the game version was 1.3.3).
	- Fixed issue: The Romanian event for seeking new alliances was triggered for Romania's overlord, if they decided for the fate of Bessarabia.
	- Fixed issue: The news event informing everyone of the British decree against Hungarian/Austro-Hungarian expansion was not showing properly (it was not set to "major", so it only showed for th UK).
	- There is now a separate news event, that fires when the UK declares war on Hungary/Austria-Hungary because of their aggressive expansion.
	- Germany can no longer take the focus "The Fate Of Czechoslovakia", unless Czechoslovakia owns all of the territory, that the event touches.
	- The MAORT industrial concern is now only available after completing the focus "Found MAORT".
	- If Hungary/Austria-Hungary has completed both "Ideological Shift" and "Territorial Policy", they will now get cores on Southern Slovakia, Berehovo, Prekmurje, Backa, and Northern Transylvania (in the Revisionist branch, this is done by the "Reassert Old Claims" focus).
	- The faction "Legio Hungarica" has been renamed to "The New Central Powers", as per the results of the open ended vote (http://www.rkursem.com/poll/view.php?cmd=view&id=299695617b3831c9a ).
	- The "Exit Attempt" focus has been removed until further notice, as I can't get the event to work (Hungary doesn't seem to be able to peace out the Allies/Soviets via the command).
	- The event asking the player whether they want the Realistic, or the Non-Realistic version of the mod is now shown at the start of the game, instead of a few weeks in. This is possible, thanks to a new feature introduced in the 1.3.3 patch of the base game.
	- The "Neubaufahrzeug" tank was renamed to "VK 30.01p".
	- The Volunteer corps have been renamed, and given a more accurate template.
	- States in Croatia, that belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, but not the Kingdom of Hungary, will no longer be integrated by Hungary.
	- Hungarian infantry weapons and support weapons were renamed according to historical sources. Many thanks to warchief1978 for doing the research.
	- Hungarian artillery equipments were given new names according to historical sources. Many thanks to warchief1978 for doing the research.
	- New focuses have been added to the conservative (neutral) branch. Ideas to further expand it are still welcome.
	- The focuses for industrial development in regained territory have been moved to the industrial branch. They no longer have the territorial demand focuses as a prerequisite.
	- The focus "Expand The Rubber Industry" has been moved lower in the industrial tree (it now has "Transdanubian Construction Grants" as a prerequisite, instead of "Found MAORT").
	- Territorial demands are now more likely to be accepted, the bigger Hungary's/Austria-Hungary's army is.
	- The Italian Negotiations focus has been reworked. It now triggers a more transparent event chain, that lets you chose what you offer, and what you want in return. For example, you can chose to offer both equipment, and political support, for just Fiume, which would make Italy more likely to accept, than if you asked for all three territories.
	- New focus in the industrial barnch: "Oil Surveys". If you own Backa, and Western Slovakia, you can prospect for oil in these states, adding some oil production.
	- New focus in the industrial branch: "Croatian Smelting Industry". Develops the steel and aluminium production in Croatia and Slavonia (at the time, these resources were mostly exported from the area).
	- New focus in the monarchist branch: "Develop Austrian Ironworking". Adds steel production, and a military factory in Upper Austria (steel production in this area is under-represented in the vanilla game).
	- New focus in the revisionist branch: "Claim Fiume". Gives you a claim on Fiume, and a wargoal to take it.
	- The focus "Demand Italian Provinces" now has "Restore The Monarchy" as a prerequisite, instead of "Merge With Czechoslovakia".
	- Removed the delay between the events of the Yugoslavian partition (except for the parts that include responses from other nations). Now you can click through most of the events without having to unpause. 
	- The focus "War With Austria" is no longer bypassed, once "Restore The Monarchy" is completed.
	
	The following changes only affect the realistic version:
		- Territorial demand focuses no longer have an army size requirement. Instead, they warn the player, that unless they have a certain army size, the demand will be ignored (giving the player a wargoal to take the state(s) in question).
	
v 3.1.2
	- Fixed issue: the Yugoslavian Partition events did not get properly reordered in the 3.1.1 update.
	- The "Maintain The Conservative Government" focus is now completed at the 1939 start instead of the (now incorrect) "Conscription Reforms".
	- The borders between Zaolzie (state) and Eastern and Western Slovakia have been slightly adjusted.
	- Added a strait in the Croatian state of Pag, that allows the owner of the state to transfer troops between the two provinces, without having access to Dalmatia and Zara.
	- Expanded the naval base in Fiume from lvl 1 to lvl 6 (it was one of the most important harbors in the region at the time).
	- Removed a Yugoslavian naval base from southern Dalmatia, and added one in Kotor instead.
	
v 3.1.1
	- Fixed issue: After the Yugoslavian partition, Hungary/Austria-Hungary got two fleets instead of one, if they annexed the Croatian coastline.
	- Fixed issue: The focus "Celebrate The Successful Revision" did not properly remove the Revisionist Spirit modifier, if it was modified by either the hungarist, or the neutral branch.
	- Fixed issue: One Yugoslavian division started in Austrian territory (in exile). It has been moved to the Yugoslavian border.
	- The Yugoslavian Partition events got reordered, so that the decision for Serbia comes before the decision for Bosnia and Dalmatia. This way, Serbia can get Bosnia and Dalmatia again.
	- The focus "Maintain The Conservative Government" now gives a modifier that boosts the popularity of neutrality.
	- Tooltips for the integration events have been updated, so that they clearly state what will happen after which choice.
	- Czechoslovakia is renamed to "Imperialist Czechoslovakia" after the Imperialist Coup has been completed (this only affects the english version).
	- If historical focuses are disabled, and Austria is in a strong faction, they have a high chance of refusing the German demand for Anschluss.

v 3.1.0
	- The Soviet Union now properly gets Bucovina, if Romania accepts the ultimatum, and Romania actually owns Bucovina.
	- If Romania is a puppet, the events for Bessarabia, and the Second Vienna Award are redirected to their overlord now.
	- The focuses "War With Austria" and "Befriend Austria" are no longer mutually exclusive (instead, their requirements have been adjusted).
	- New focus in the military branch: "Szekely Mountaineers". Similar to the "Saint Ladislaus Paratrooper Division", this gives a template, and a matching unit.
	- New state in Croatia: Pag (Small island between Fiume and Zara, represented as coastline in the game). Italy now only gets claim to this, instead of the whole of Croatia, when completing the Yugoslavian claims focus.
	- Yugoslavia is now less likely to join the Little Entente, if they have signed the Pact of Everlasting Friendship with Hungary (especially, if they joined Hungary's faction).
	- A new "Claims" system was introduced, that keeps track of which states Hungary/Austria-Hungary lays claim to.
		The system is mostly hidden from the eyes of the user, it is most easily tracked on the requirement section of the "Celebrate The Successful Revision" focus.
		States are claimed by the "Revisionism", and the "Restore The Monarchy" focus (the claimed states include the historical Kingdom of Hungary, and Austro-Hungarian Monarchy respectively).
		These claims can be adjusted/renounced by things like the Yugoslavian Everlasting Friendship, via an event that asks the player, whether to keep the claims or not.
		Things like the "Reassert Old Claims", and the "Celebrate The Successful Revision" focuses take claims into account (eg. "Reassert Old Claims" won't add claims/cores to territory, that is no longer claimed by Hungary/Austria-Hungary).
	- A new event handles the self-governance of Slovakia. The event can trigger if Hungary owns all of Slovakia (including Carpathian Ruthenia), and enables the installment of a Slovakian puppet government. The puppet state will be assigned territory based on the player's decision. Hungary/Austria-Hungary will renounce claims on any territory that is handed over to the puppet.
	- If Croatia exists, and owns some of its core land, Hungary/Austria-Hungary can get an event, that lets them renounce their Croatian claims.
	- Czechoslovakia should no longer give in to German demands, if they are in a faction with Hungary/Austria-Hungary.
	- The Sudetenland demand is no longer handled by the Munich conference, if Czechoslovakia is in a faction. In such a case, Czechoslovakia decides whether to agree to the demands or not.
	- Hungarian ship classes have been given unique names, thanks to warchief1978. Due to in-game limitations, Austria-Hungary gets the same names.
	- The Successful Revision national spirit now grants +10% Division attack and defence on core territory.
	- Hungarian Aluminium (resource) has been moved from Northern Hungary, to the more historically, and geographically accurate Transdanubia.
	- The insane technology boost upon forming Austria-Hungary, or merging with Czechoslovakia should be gone now, thanks to the feedback from steam user AdidasF-CZ.
	- The Horthy-Hitler meeting now has an effect, and doesn't break the game. If an agreement is reached during the meeting, AI Germany should now decide according to the agreement.
	- Albania now gets cores on any states that are given to them during the Partition, and are mostly inhabited by ethnic Albanians (Tetovo, Prizren, Ulcinj).
	- New focuses in the communist branch. Deciding between Kádár and Rákosi is now a meaningful choice, as their mutually exclusive branches now have different focuses. Kádár's branch focuses on welfare, and maintaining relations with the west, while Rákosi's branch emphasizes hardline, stalinist communism (collectivization, planned industry, and cracking down on political opposition).
	- The ideology of János Kádár was changed from stalinism to leninism (no gameplay effect).
	- The tooltip for the focus "War With Austria" has been fixed (the actual trigger conditions are unchanged).
	- The focus "Post War Reorganization" is now available while the country is at war, as the flag that previously enabled the focus is not properly set, if Hungary is not one of the primary belligerents of the war.
	- If Hungary is not yet at war with Romania, but Romania is at war with the Allies, Hungary will get an event, where they can decide to offer their help against Romania, in return for claims on Transylvania. Hungary can only get this event, if they are not yet in a faction, or are part of the Allies.
	- Bács-Kiskun is now included in the "Hungarian Motorway Network" focus.
	- New focuses have been introduced in the revisionist branch, that cover the (planned) actions of the hungarist government of Ferenc Szálasi. The focuses include the plans of Szálasi, for future social, work, and state reforms in Hungary.
	- If fascism is the ruling party, the focus "Celebrate The Successful Revision" now gives a slightly different modifier, with the name "United Hungarian Lands".
	- New focuses have been introduced in the revisionist branch, that expand on the possibilities of the conservative government, that Hungary starts with. This branch is mutually exclusive with the hungarist branch mentioned above. The focuses include:
		Banning the Arrow Cross Party
		Reinforcing the position of the regent, even going as far, as enthroning Horthy, or electing a Habsburg to the throne.
		Dismantling the monarchy, and turning the country into a Parlimentary Monarchy, or a Republic (this enables semi-meaningful elections, that let the player choose, which candidate they want to elect).
	- The event "Slovenia for Burgenland" can no longer fire, if Hungary is at war with Austria.
	- The state Primorska is now included in the focus "Demand Italian Provinces"
	- Fixed issue: The new event "British Decree against Hungarian expansion" was not firing properly.
	- The focus "Hungarian SS" has been reworked. It no longer gives a division and a template to Hungary, but instead gives two SS divisions to Germany. Hungary gets subsidies for their heavy tank production, and a tank research bonus. (It is not historically feasible for Hungary to have their own SS divisions, as they were all controlled by Germany)
	
	The following changes only affect the realistic version:
		- Bonuses from the national spirits "Industrial Effort" and "Fortification Effort" have been reduced.
		- The focuses "War With Austria", and "Demand Italian Provinces" now have army size requirements.
	
v 3.0.3
	- After hours of pulling out my hair, I finally managed to locate the source of the crashes:
		The crash during the "Fate of Czechoslovakia" events was caused by a conflict with the original game's event files. I have reverted the code of the event, so it no longer takes the Horthy-Hitler agreement into account. This is sadly the only way (that I could think of) to stop the crashes right now, but I'll try to contact someone from Paradox to help me find a solution.
		The crash during the Partition of Yugoslavia was casued by some mislocated buildings, that got stuck outside of their respective states after some of the border changes in 3.0.0. The buildings.txt file has been regenerated, and Yugoslavian states should be all fine now.
	
v 3.0.2
	- Duplicate events have been removed from the territorial integration events, this should hopefully fix the crashes, that some users are experiencing.
	- Some details about Istria have been adjusted (population lowered, + it is now a Croatian core)
	- States added in v3.0.0 have been added to supply areas.
	
v 3.0.1
	- Some hidden files (added by google drive) have been removed, as they might be causing crashes in the mod.
	- Fixed issue: Austria was not getting the alliance event in v3.0.0, due to an oversight.
	
v 3.0.0
#The 3.0 version comes with a multitude of balance changes, that aim to make the mod more realistic. Those who still want to play the old, less realistic version, can chose to do so through an event, that fires at the start of each game (the event shows up after a few ingame days). Note, that some balance changes will still influence the less realistic version, this is necessary to make it easier to keep the two versions compatible.#

The following changes affect both versions:
	- Russian localisation has been corrected for the previous version (thanks to VulturGryphus).
	- Szamos and Tisza (rivers) have been corrected.
	- New provinces have been added: Maramures/Northern Partium/Kotor/Primorska/Tetovo/Prizren/Ulcinj, and some province borders have been corrected. 
	- Crisana (province) has been renamed to Southern Partium. Triest (victory point) has been renamed to Koper.
	- The political structure of Hungary in 1936 and 1939 has been revised, with Horthy and his government moving to the "neutral" zone, and Szálasi taking over as the proper fascist leader.
	- The focus "Revenge For Trianon" has been moved from the monarchist branch, and is now directly available after the "Revisionism" focus. As a new requirement, it needs Hungary/Austria-Hungary to be powerful, or have strong friends in Europe.
	- New event pictures have been added for many events, that had a generic picture previously.
	- Most Hungarian national spirits now have unique pictures.
	- Some of the early ship technologies for Hungary and Austria-Hungary have been given unique names.
	- Unique ship names have been added for Austria-Hungary and Hungary, for all classes (thanks to warchief1978)
	- Tank variations for the light and medium tanks in the tank tree, have been given unique names (thanks to warchief1978)
	- The T2 heavy tank (Tiger I) has been replaced with the Hungarian M43 Tas.
	- The focuses "Anschluss", "Demand Sudetenland", and "Fate Of Czechoslovakia" now trigger events for the overlords of Austria/Czechoslovakia, if they are puppets. This should prevent them, from giving away territory without the permission of their masters. 
	- Events have been added, that cover the historical meeting between Horthy and Hitler. During these events (which are triggered by Germany starting the "Fate Of Czechoslovakia" focus), Hungary and Germany can agree on the terms of the partition of Czechoslovakia. Germany can decide to ignore the agreement if they want to (though the AI is forced to hold up the agreed terms). Note, that agreement is not necessarily reached. There are possible outcomes, where the meeting is inconclusive, and Germany is not bound by any promises.
	- Some focuses are now only available, if Hungary/Austria-Hungary is fully independent (mostly international focuses, like faction foundations, or territorial demands)
	- Focus, and event driven wargoal generations have been adjusted: In cases, where the reason for war is territorial dispute (eg. Czechoslovakia not handing over Slovakia), the goal of the war is now to take one or more states, instead of outright annexing the country.
	- New focus in the revisionist branch: "Help Finland". If Finland is fighting a defensive war against the Soviet Union, Hungary can invite them into their faction.
	- New focus in the revisionist branch: "Celebrate The Successful Revision". This replaces the Revisionist Spirit national spirit with a better one. If the UK declared war against Hungary/Austria-Hungary earlier, due to their excessive expansion, Hungary/Austria-Hungary can get an event - after completing this focus - that asks the UK for peace. If they accept, Hungary/Austria-Hungary will hand over all of the territory, that they haven't claimed, and a white peace will be signed with the UK and its allies.
	- New focus in the revisionist branch: "Extensive Cosncription". Changes the conscription law to Extensive Conscription, if you already have Limited Conscription.
	- New focus in the revisionist branch: "The Rise Of Hungarism". Since Hungary now starts with a neutral government, a separate focus branch has been added, that lets you convert to fascism. This branch will be expanded in later versions.
	- New focus in the nationalist branch: "Hungarian SS": gives a new division template, and one semi-elite unit.
	- New focus in the army branch: "Saint Ladislaus Paratrooper Division": Gives a new (paratrooper) division template, and one semi-elite unit.
	- It is now possible to resist the Arrow Cross Party's coup, that can happen after the exit attempt. Should Hungary chose to do so, a civil war will erupt (with the fascists having an advantage over the current government), and Hungary will be removed from the Axis.
	- Since the 1.3.2 Patch fixes the disappearing troops, Hungary no longer gets extra divisions when restoring Austria-Hungary.
	- Anti-Air has been removed from the starting divisions of Hungary. Though historically accurate, anti-air just doesn't fit balance wise in a 1936 division.
	- New focus pictures have been added for various focuses.
	
The following changes only affect the official, realistic version:
	- The focus "Reassert Old Claims" now only gives cores on states that are primarily inhabited by Hungarians. Hungary/Austria-Hungary will get claims on the rest of the old territory.
	- Integration of former Hungarian/Austro-Hungarian territory is now handled by events and modifiers.
		Once you acquire a state in a region (eg. Transylvania, or Slovakia), you'll get an event asking you whether you want the region to be integrated, or to remain "colonial"
		If you decide to integrate it, you'll get cores on its states (that are owned by you), and get a stacking penalty to conscription (and some other things), that gets stronger with every state you are currently integrating.
		While the integration is progressing, you can get events that influence the process, either region-based, or state-based.
		If you acquire a new state in the region you decided to integrate, you'll get an event that informs you that the integration is ready to start (you can decide to exempt states from integration in this case).
	- New focuses have been added, that can speed up integration. The first of these focuses is available, if you are playing the realistic version, and own territory, that was formerly Hungarian (or Austro-Hungarian, if you are Ausitra-Hungary).
	- Various focuses have gotten new requirements
		Alliance focuses now require a certain relation with the target country
		Territorial demands require a certain army size
	- Various events have been adjusted, so that neighbouring countries no longer give in (easily) to each and every request of Hungary.
	- The focuses "Hungarian Motorway Network" and "Concentric Road Network" now give less infrastructure, and no free building slots.
	- The focuses "Aviation Effort" and "Project Toldi" are now only available, if the country does not have the national spirit "Trianon Restrictions" (Hungary was not supposed to produce any armored vehicles, or aircraft according to the Treaty of Trianon).

v 2.9.4
	- Fixed issue: The Burgenland referendum was not working properly, ever since 2.9.0, due to a bug.
	
v 2.9.3
	- The Russian translation was updated (thanks to VulturGryphus).
	- New focus pictures were added across the focus tree (thanks to Paradox Hungary).
	- Some missing tooltips were added in the Hungarian version.

v 2.9.2
	- The focus "War With Austria" is now bypassed, if Austria doesn't exist, and its territory is owned by Hungary.
	- The focus "Restore The Monarchy" no longer triggers the German intervention event, if Austria doesn't exist (which means Hungary already conquered them).
	- Infrastructure in Beregszász (Berehove) has been raised to 6.
	- Victory points in Hungary have been adjusted (Pécs is now 3, and so is Debrecen).
	- Leader portraits have been beautified, and Hungarian localisation has been corrected at many places (both thanks to Paradox Hungary).
	- A temporary fix has been issued for the disappearing Austrian divisions: Austria-Hungary now gets all of the starting Austrian troops upon formation. This effect will be removed, once Paradox Interactive fixes the disappearing divisions bug.
	
v 2.9.1
	- One of the newly added states was not part of a supply zone, this is now fixed.
	- Fiume and Bács-Kiskun were missing from the infrastructure focuses, this has also been fixed.
	
v 2.9.0
	- The state of Northern Dalmatia was added (detached from Croatia), and Dalmatia was renamed to Southern Dalmatia.
	- Changes throughout the Yugoslavian partition event chain, most notably the inclusion of Northern Dalmatia, and separate events for Croatia, Ruma and Pancevo.
	- If Italy's claims (mostly just Dalmatia) are appeased during the Partition of Yugoslavia, and Hungary/Austria-Hungary is a faction leader, they might offer an alliance after the conference. The player is notified of the claims in the description of the partition events.
	- Freely giving non-core territory to nations during the Yugoslavian partition now results in a stacking opinion modifier (given at the end of the peace conference), which gets bigger, the more territory is given. For example, Giving Italy both Southern and Northern Dalmatia will result in a +20 opinion modifier, while giving them Slovenia in addition to the previous two, will result in a +30.
	- The ideology of the Arrow Cross Party has been changed to Hungarism. The name of the party has also been changed to Arrow Cross Party - Hungarist Movement (the two parties ruled together, though the Arrow Cross Party was the more prominent).
	- The state of Bács-Kiskun was detached from the state of Alföld, so that Alföld is no longer split by the river Tisza.
	- The map position of land forts in Hungary has been adjusted, so that most of them point towards the borders now (has no gameplay effect).
	- Germany can now take the focus "Fate of Czechoslovakia", regardless of whether Czechoslovakia is in a faction, but Czechoslovakia is now more likely to fight back, if they are in a faction with anyone.
	- A new event has been added, that covers the historical "Hungarian-Slovakian Small War", a small border conflict between Hungary and Czechoslovakia after the First Vienna Award. Both sides considered the operation a success, even though it didn't result in a significant border change.
	- For owners of the "Together for Victory" DLC, the event during which the Arrow Cross Party takes power, now also results in Hungary becoming a Dominion of Germany. For those without the DLC, the event is unchanged.
	- Hungary now gets a unit of "Volunteer Corps" (Szabadcsapat), after receiving Novi Sad during the partition of Yugoslavia. This also applies to the German focus "First Ljubljana Award".
	- Hungary now gets a core on Novi Sad, when receiving it during the First Ljubljana Award.
	- The Independent State of Croatia now properly gets the state of Ruma, if Germany decides to only puppet them in the "Fate of Yugoslavia" event.
	- Some focuses have gotten new pictures, that came along with the 1.3 patch.
	- New focus in the monarchist branch: "Revenge For Trianon", gives a wargoal against France.
	- Technology sharing focuses were added to the corresponding branches (Axis, Allies, Comintern), which are available for owners of the "Together for Victory" DLC.
	- The Axis branch was restructured slightly
	- The focus "Conscription Reforms" has been moved to the democratic/communist branch, and in its place, a new focus called "Expand The Levente Associations" was added. The focus adds a similar modifier to the one that "Conscription Reforms" gives.
	- New focus in the democratic branch: "Referendum For Southern Slovakia" (mutually exclusive with-, and has the same requirements as "Peace With Our Neighbors").
	- New focus in the democratic branch: "Settlement With Yugoslavia" (requires "Referendum For Slovakia").
	- The Visegrád Group part of the democratic branch was extended with various focuses, including one that invites Yugoslavia to the faction.
	- The focus "Wilson's 10th Point" now requires you to own at least one state in all of the six regions, that make up the federation proposed by Woodrow Wilson (Austria-Carniola, Hungary (Slovakia included), Bohemia-Moravia, Galicia-Lodomeria, Transylvania, Croatia-Bosnia)
	- Upon completing the focus "Wilson's 10th Point", the player can decide to rename the country to Danubian Federation, instead of Austro-Hungarian Federation. The name change also comes with a new flag and map color (though the map color doesn't switch immediately for some reson). This is purely cosmetic for the time being, but might have domestic political consequences in future versions.
	- Romania can now issue a counterdemand when Hungary/Austria-Hungary demands Transylvania. If they do, Hungary can decide to cede the Alföld region (everything from the river Tisza to the Romanian border), simply refuse, or declare war in response.
	- Hungary now starts the game with claims on Prekmurje and Novi Sad.
	- The national spirit "Fascism losing popularity" is now timed, meaning that it expires after a certain time, instead of being removed through focuses.
	- The modifiers for the Kádár- and Rákosi Administration have been made permanent (meaning, they aren't lost, when the single-party system is implemented), and political power gain has been removed from the single party system modifier.
	- Various mismatched localisation keys were fixed in Romanian and Yugoslavian events of the mod.
	- The focus "Burgas Industrial Development Project" now grants 75 political power upon completion.
	
v 2.8.4
	- Fixed issue: If a game was finished as Austria-Hungary, Hungary would show up as Austria-Hungary in a new game.
	- Slight modifications to the focus tree (mostly placement).
	- The conscription penalty from the modifier "Trianon Restrictions" is now a percentage of total manpower, instead of a flat penalty to recruitable population.
	
v 2.8.3
	- Some typos were corrected in the localisation files.
	- The mod now uses a few features introduced in the 1.3 patch.
	- The transition from Hungary to Austria-Hungary is now finally as smooth as it could be, thanks to the cosmetic tags feature.
	- Hungary got its place at the 1936 and 1939 bookmarks, and received a short description for both scenarios.
	
v 2.8.2
	- The event "Györi program goes against Trianon restrictions" should only trigger once now.
	- The mod is now compatible with the 1.3 (Torch) version of the base game.
	
v 2.8.1
	- A missing event localisation in the Hungarian version has been fixed
	- Serbia and Montenegro got new colors, that better fit their usual map colors (blue-ish shade)
	- The flags of Hungary got a slight color correction, so they better fit the new Austro-Hungarian flags
	- Minor corrections in the Hungarian localisation (thanks to Paradox Hungary)
	
v 2.8.0
	- Hungary now starts with a modifier called "Trianon Restrictions", which represents the military restrictions set by the allies of WW1. The modifier can be removed through The Gyõri Program, by joining a faction, or on its own (given enough time).
	- If Italy accepts Fiume + Zara for Slovenia, Hungary/Austria-Hungary now has the option to only take one of them.
	- New fascist, and communist flags for Austria-Hungary, thanks to OrangeWulf. The neutral version has also had its colours adjusted, to match the other flags.
	- The population of Fiume has been raised to 150k, which represents the size of the city more accurately during this time.
	- Some inaccuracies were corrected in the event localisations.
	- Unique advisor portraits were added for almost all Hungarian political advisors. Thanks again to Paradox Hungary for the effort he put into making this happen.
	- The industrial concern Ganz Villamossági Gyár now has a unique icon instead of a generic one.
	- It no longer matters, what order the "Restore The Monarchy" and "Reassert Old Claims" focuses are completed in. If you complete the "Reassert Old Claims" first, you will still get the Austro-Hungarian claims, once you form the country.
	- Upon completing either the "Restore The Monarchy", or "Reassert Old Claims" focus, the surrounding nations (Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia) get the option to form the Little Entente alliance, as an answer to this threat. If the alliance did not form as the result of one of the focuses, it will not form after the second one.
	- New focus in the axis branch: "Exit Attempt". This focus now manually starts the exit attempt event chain, which was previously self-triggered. The German assisted Arrow Cross Party coup is now also integrated in this event chain, accurately representing the historical events that occurred after the exit attempt of Hungary.
	- The focus "Revive The Navy" now costs 140 days, instead of 70, and adds two new admirals when it is completed:
		Ödön Trunkwalter
		Kálmán Hardy
	- New focus in the research branch: "The Bay-Group". The focus is available after "Military Intelligence", and requires the technology "Radar". Upon completion, it builds lvl1 radar stations in Hungary's 3 starting provinces.
	- New focus in the industrial branch: "Hungarian Lloyd Aircraft Factory". The focus adds a military factory, and if you have no other aircraft manufacturer selected, adds the Lloyd Aircraft (heavy aircraft designer) as one.
	- The modifier "Fascism losing popularity" now decreases fascist support by 0.2 each day, instead of 0.1, to allow for faster conversion, should Hungary wish to go democratic or communist.
	- The province of Fiume is now included in the focus "Concentric Road Network"
	- New focus in the communist branch: "Soviet License Trade"
	- New focus in the democratic branch: "Allied License Trade"
	- New focus in the communist branch: "The Kádár Administration" (mutually exclusive with "The Rákosi Administration")
	- The focus "A New Beginning" has been reworked into "Leaning Westward", and gives opinion boost with western democratic countries
	- New sub-branch in the democratic branch: "The Visegrád Group" (mutually exclusive with "Leaning Westward"), this allows Hungary to create her own democratic faction with surrounding countries.
		Initially, Czechoslovakia, and Poland are invited
		Through a focus, the faction can be extended to the north, by inviting the Baltic nations
		A focus enables close economic cooperation, similar to that of the modern EU, within the faction, which gives trade relation boosts between all members (new members get the bonuses shortly after entering)
	- New focus in the monarchist branch: "Wilson's 10th Point". This turns Austria-Hungary into a democratic, constitutional monarchy, with Otto von Habsburg still being the de jure ruler. This feature will be expanded upon in future versions.
	- The state of Carpathian Ruthenia has been divided into two pieces. During the events of the First Vienna Award, Hungary is given the southern bit, just as it happened historically.
	
v 2.7.3
Minor (out of schedule) hotfix
	- Fixed issue: One of the options was not showing in the event "The fate of Dalmatia", also, there were some issues with the Hungarian localisation (these should now be fixed)
	- The Hungarian localisation was updated, and corrected (thanks to Paradox Hungary)

v 2.7.2
	- Slight correction to the source of the river Tisza (added in 2.7.1)
	- New leader portraits for the following leaders of Hungary/Austria-Hungary (many thanks to Paradox Hungary):
		Ferenc Szálasi
		Otto von Habsburg
		Endre Bajcsy Zsilinszyky
		(bonus: advisor portrait for Magdolna Purgly)
	- Minor adjustments to population and hungarian localisation of states
	- Fixed issue: Hungary was not getting a core on Fiume when completing the "Reassert Old Claims" focus
	
v 2.7.1
	- The river Tisza is now finally present in the game (small design error in the vanilla game)
	
v 2.7.0
	- Various bugfixes in the Yugoslavian partition event chain.
	- Dalmatia can now be given to Italy regardless of what other states they own.
	- New event that allows the player to crown Horthy as King of Hungary.
	- The focus "Reinstate Horthy" now triggers an event, which can turn Horthy into an admiral, or a chief of navy (previously, only the latter was possible).
	- Reduced world tension from some of the demands made through the focus tree.
	- Adjusted the population of Prekmurje (Muraköz).
	- Hungary now starts with some of the early ship designs researched (the ones that fit any of the former Austro-Hungarian ship categories).
	- Upon partitioning Yugoslavia (and gaining Croatia at the very least), Hungary/Austria-Hungary will inherit some (7) Yugoslavian ships.
	- The focus "Befriend Bulgaria" in the Italian focus tree is now bypassed, if Bulgaria is already in a faction. This should prevent Bulgaria from leaving the Hungarian faction for no good reason. Similarly, Germany is no longer able to influence Turkey through their national focus tree, if they are already in a faction.
	- The westernmost province of Ruma has been transferred to Croatia (state).
	- The province of Fiume has been turned into a separate state, controlled by Italy (enclave, similar to Zara).
	- The state of Croatia now has a lvl 1 port just south of Fiume
	- Montenegro has been given a friendlier map color.
	- The 1936 start for Hungary has been slightly adjusted, so that the industry isn't crippled by the reinforcement demand for many months.
	- New focus in the industrial branch: "Expand The Rubber Industry": Gives some rubber production in Transdanubia.
	- New focuses in the army research branch, that cover the license trading of Hungary in ww2 (Sweden: tanks and artillery, Germany: planes)
	- New focus in the axis branch: "Assistance From The General Staff": Should Germany agree, this will give a national spirit boosting some military stats, and also potentially some german generals.
	- Various new focuses in the revisionist branch, that provide more interaction with your allies (Bulgaria, Poland, Turkey)
