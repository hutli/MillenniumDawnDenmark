 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_OTTO_I_DESC:0 "Otto von Habsburg was Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary in name only, after the empire was dissolved in 1918. In these times of political turmoil, the people of Austria and Hungary have called upon him to unite the two countries once again."
 POLITICS_FERENC_SZALASI_DESC:0 "Ferenc Szálasi was installed by the German government, to ensure Hungarian loyalty and cooperation during the war."
 POLITICS_MIKLOS_HORTHY_DESC:0 "Miklós Horthy was a rear-admiral of the Austro-Hungarian navy, but after the dissolution of the empire, when the Hungarian Soviet Republic took power, he was one of the organizers of the counter-revolutionary army in Szeged. He played an important role in restoring the Hungarian monarchy, eventually accepting the position of regent, thus making Hungary into a 'Kingdom without a king'."
 POLITICS_MATYAS_RAKOSKI_DESC:0 "Rákosi was the General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party after the second world war ended. His rule was defined by hardcore communism, and a personal cult, similar to that of Stalin. The unofficial motto of his system was 'Whoever is not with us, is against us', as opposed to the later system of János Kádár, which had the friendlier approach of 'Whoever is not against us, is with us'."
 POLITICS_ENDRE_BAJCSY_ZSILINSZKY_DESC:0 "Bajcsy Zsilinszky was a right wing democrat in pre-war Hungary. He was a staunch opposer of Germany's expansionist politics, and detested alignment with Hitler's Axis."
 POLITICS_JANOS_KADAR_DESC:0 "Historically, Kádár was the successor to Mátyás Rákosi, and held slightly different beliefs, than his predecessor. While Rákosi's system was characterized by hardline communism, Kádár's is remembered as "Show-window communism", meaning that it was much like a showcase of communist prosperity towards the west. His rule was loved by many, though the system was not sustainable, due to the enormous loans the country had to take to pay for it."

 #Bookmark descriptions
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hungary became independent during the Great War after a long time of foreign rulership, and thus, master of her own fate again. The Treaty of Trianon left the country with one third of its former territory, and half of its former population. Many would like to see the old borders restored, but the surrounding nations are not at all willing to compromise. There are still supporters of the old Habsburg monarchy, but communist and liberal ideas have also taken root in the country.\n\nThe next few years might very well decide the fate of Hungary for the remainder of the century."
 HUN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The past few years saw the restoration of Southern Slovakia, and Carpathian Ruthenia to the Kingdom of Hungary. Now, with the assistance of Germany, the government is looking to negotiate the revision of Romanian borders, and it looks like Romania might be willing to cooperate, under German arbitration. Hungary is slowly coming under the influence of The Third Reich, inevitably drawing itself into the coming conflict.\n\n Only time will tell, if Hungary rises from the mud of war victorious, regaining lost territory, or beaten, losing more than ever before."
