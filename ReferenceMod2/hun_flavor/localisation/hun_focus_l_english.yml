 HUN_invite_yugoslavia:0 "Invite Yugoslavia"

 HUN_conscription_reforms_desc:0 "Outright extending conscription might couse public outrage, but if we carefully juggle with laws, we might still acquire a bigger pool of manpower.

 HUN_invite_bulgaria:0 "Invite Bulgaria"
 HUN_invite_bulgaria_desc:0 "Bulgaria has served our cause in the Great War out of necessity more than friendship. Maybe they could do so again, if we strengthened our relationship with them a bit.

 HUN_reinstate_the_habsburgs_desc:0 "The monarchy is now stable, and there is decent support for a legitimist movement.

The long regency of Horthy can finally come to an end, and order can be restored to the Kingdom of Hungary."
 HUN_enthrone_horthy:0 "Enthrone Horthy"
 HUN_enthrone_horthy_desc:0 "Horthy is practically reigning as a king now, in all but name. There are plenty of people, who support his coronation, and having a king again, would certainly lift the spirits of the nation."
 HUN_dismantle_the_monarchy:0 "Dismantle The Monarchy"
 HUN_dismantle_the_monarchy_desc:0 "We have had enough of the authoritarian rulership of kings and regents. The monarchy is outdated and obsolete. We will decide upon a new form of government, where the head of state wields less authority, and the true power will be given to the people."
 HUN_swing_politics:0 "Swing Politics"
 HUN_swing_politics_desc:0 "We have to keep our diplomatic options open at all times, if we don't want to end up on the losing side again. By 'swinging' back and forth between the allies and the axis, we can try to remain undecided for as long as it is possible, and only choose sides once we are sure that we are making the right choice."
 HUN_expansionism:0 "Expansionism"
 HUN_expansionism_desc:0 "We have stayed neutral long enough. We need to take our fate into our own hands, and fight those who would see our country destroyed. The lands of Hungary will be reclaimed by force, not by dmeans of diplomacy."
 HUN_countryside_development:0 "Countryside Development"
 HUN_countryside_development_desc:0 "We can not let the capital become our only source of industrial capacity. By dispersing factories all over the countryside, we will always have a sufficient amount of industry, that we can tap into if we need to."
 HUN_reassert_old_claims:0 "Reassert Old Claims"
 HUN_reassert_old_claims_desc:0 "It is bad enough that the Allies have ignored the reasonable request of Albert Apponyi at the Treaty of Versailles, to limit the territorial losses of Hungary, since then, the world seems to have forgotten that our country was once one of the greatest in the region. The historical territory of the Kingdom of Hungary has to be restored, thus, we are openly announcing our claims on the lost provinces."
 HUN_claim_fiume:0 "Claim Fiume"
 HUN_claim_fiume_desc:0 "The port of Fiume was contested even in the times of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, but it has now come under the occupation of Italy. It is rightfully ours, but the Italians would never agree to just hand it over. We need to apply more than just diplomatic pressure if we want to take it."
 HUN_demand_slovakia:0 "Demand Slovakia"
 HUN_demand_slovakia_desc:0 "Slovakia - or Czechoslovakia for that matter - isn't and never was a viable country. It is merely a construct of Trianon, and as such, is not recognised by the new Hungarian government. Czechoslovakia will cede all territories in question, or we take it by force. The threat of losing their entire country might be enough to let go of half of it."

 HUN_yugoslavian_pact_of_everlasting_friendship_desc:0 "Even though Yugoslavia holds provinces that should be ours, they would make a great ally, if we were to oppose Germany. They foster good relations with the allies, and are unlikely to submit to German pressure. We should settle relations between our countries, and sign a pact of 'Everlasting Friendship", which would pave the way for further cooperation."
 HUN_partition_yugoslavia:0 "Partition Yugoslavia"
 HUN_partition_yugoslavia_desc:0 "This monstrosity of a country called Yugoslavia is yet another ugly product of the peace treaties after the Great War. If we can gain enough influence in the area, or convice some major powers to back us, we could arrange for a repartition of the Yugoslavian territory."
 HUN_demand_transylvania:0 "Demand Transylvania"
 HUN_demand_transylvania_desc:0 "Transylvania, one of the oldest core parts of our country was wrongly assumed to be rightfully Romanian land, and shall be ceded to our glorious country immediately. If the Romanian government decides to hold on to it, we might just take it by force, and while we're at it, we can conquer the rest of their country."
 HUN_threaten_war_for_banat:0 "Threaten War For Banat"
 HUN_threaten_war_for_banat_desc:0 "Although Banat is not primarily inhabited by Hungarians, it would be strategically beneficial to acquire it, as it makes our southern borders excessively long. Romania is now weak enough, that they might give in to just about any demands we make, and we should use this to our advantage. We will threaten to declare war on them, if they don't draw their forces back from Banat."
 HUN_croatian_ports:0 "Croatian Ports"
 HUN_croatian_ports_desc:0 "Having been landlocked for decades, our experience with naval affairs has detoriated somewhat.

 HUN_metal_processing_in_vojvodina:0 "Metal Processing In Vojvodina"
 HUN_metal_processing_in_vojvodina_desc:0 "The province of Novi Sad is one of the least likely to be attacked, and thus serves a strategic role in developing our industry.

 HUN_croatian_smelting_industry:0 "Croatian Smelting Industry"
 HUN_croatian_smelting_industry_desc:0 "Croatia has vast amounts of resources, that are not properly utilized. Developing the smelting industry in Croatia and Slavonia would enable us to make better use of the bauxite and iron in the area."
 HUN_the_arpad_line:0 "The Árpád Line"
 HUN_the_arpad_line_desc:0 "At one point or another, we have to consider the possibility of a Soviet attack from the east. The red army has to be stopped right at our doorstep, the Carpathian mountains, otherwise they will quickly advance through our country. The terrain in Carpathian Ruthenia is perfectly fit for the construction of a strong defensive line, which shall be known as the 'Árpád Line', after the head of Hungarian tribes, Árpád."
 HUN_extend_the_arpad_line:0 "Extend The Árpád Line"
 HUN_extend_the_arpad_line_desc:0 "We are now well defended from the northeast, but the newly acquired region of Transylvania lies defenseless. The Árpád Line needs to be extended to the southeast, all the way through the Eastern Carpathians, if we hope to defend against the red army."
 HUN_coal_mines_in_nyitra:0 "Coal Mines In Nyitra"

 HUN_found_maort:0 "Found MAORT"
 HUN_found_maort_desc:0 "Some American bussinessmen have funded a prospecting expedition in our country, and found considerable amounts of oil near the villages of Lovászi and Hahót. They proposed the creation of a joint company, under the name MAORT (Magyar-Amerikai Olajipari Rt.), which would operate in the area. Most of the oil would end up in our hands, so there is little to lose."
 HUN_oil_surveys:0 "Oil Surveys"

 HUN_artillery_factory_in_szeged_desc:0 "Artillery is an essential part of any division. Our country still lacks a proper line of production for the equipment used by artillery units, but a small arms factory in Szeged could be expanded to facilitate a new production line dedicated to artillery."
 HUN_budapest_ferihegy_airport:0 "Budapest Ferihegy Airport"

 HUN_fighter_production_innovations:0 "Fighter Production Innovations"
 HUN_fighter_production_innovations_desc:0 "Perhaps assigning our entire industry to the production of fighters is not the smartest way of going about creating the large air force we desire. If we could make some progress towards production innovations, we could build smarter, instead of harder."
 HUN_targeted_destruction_focus:0 "Targeted Destruction Focus"
 HUN_targeted_destruction_focus_desc:0 "With our current industrial capacity, we cannot hope to outmatch any of the major powers' air forces with fighters.
